# Picture-in-Picture  

### Overview  
**Picture-in-Picture (PiP)** is a React-based web application that allows users to play videos in a floating window while interacting with other content on the same page or browsing other tabs. This functionality is implemented using the browser's `requestPictureInPicture()` and `exitPictureInPicture()` methods.  

This project demonstrates how to integrate PiP functionality with state management for seamless user experience, making it a great example of modern, interactive web application development.

- **Event Handling**: Properly handles state changes during PiP transitions.  
- **Responsive Design**: Works flawlessly across devices and screen sizes.  
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Built with performance in mind using React.js.
